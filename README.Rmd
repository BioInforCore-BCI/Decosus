# Dependencies
Decosus depends on certain published signatures and methods. The packages associated with the methods are configured to install automatically. However, you can installl them directry if you have problems getting them on your machine.
Use: 
  devtools::install_github('dviraran/xCell', force = TRUE)
  devtools::install_github("ebecht/MCPcounter",ref="master", subdir="Source")
  devtools::install_github("GfellerLab/EPIC", build_vignettes = TRUE)
You may need to install devtools.

## Installation
You can install the released version of Decosus from [github](https://github.com/caanene1) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github('caanene1/Decosus')
```

Alternatively, you can install from source in your working directory with:

``` r
install.packages("Decosus_0.1.2.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

## Example

To use Decosus on an expression matrix, simply run: 
```{r example}
results <- Decosus::cosDeco(x = df, platform = "Array")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
